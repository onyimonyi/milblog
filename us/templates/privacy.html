                    your message or request. We will only share the information you give us with another government

                    system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as
                    assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design
                    specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.</p>
                <p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this
                    government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify
                    unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.</p>
                <p>Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify

                <p>When you visit a page on Army.mil, the internet browser on your computer may download a small file
                    (commonly called a "cookie") so that our website can recognize your computer when you use Army.mil
                    in the future. Army.mil uses first-party cookies to report on visitor interactions. These cookies
                    are used to store non-personally identifiable information. Browsers do not share first-party cookies
                    across domains. The U.S. Army does not use the information associated with cookies to track
                    individual user activity on the Internet outside Army websites, nor does it share the data obtained
                    through such technologies, without the user's explicit consent, with other departments or agencies.
                    The Department of the Army does not keep a database of information obtained from the use of
                    cookies.</p>
                <p>Cookies are enabled by default to optimize website functionality and customize user experience, but
                    users can choose not to accept the use of these cookies by changing the settings on their local
                    computer's web browser. The USA.gov website, <a href="{% url 'military:home-view'%}">usa.gov/optout-instructions</a>,
                    provides general instructions on how to opt out of cookies and other commonly used web measurement
                    and customization technologies. Opting out of cookies still permits users to access comparable
                    information and services; however, it may take longer to navigate or interact with the website if a
                    user is required to fill out certain information repeatedly.</p><h4>Specific
